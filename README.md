# Orbit-Diagrams
(Maple) A routine for computing and plotting orbit diagrams of the quadratic, logistic, and other function families. This came out of a course manual I authored for Duquesne University as a post-undergraduate project. The full code and outputs are posted as a PDF excerpt from the manual. Iâ€™ll upload the original source files as soon as I track the rest of them down (I wrote this quite some time ago!).
